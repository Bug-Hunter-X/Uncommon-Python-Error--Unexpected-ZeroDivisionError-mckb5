This repository demonstrates a subtle, uncommon error in Python related to ZeroDivisionError. The provided code includes an example of a function where a ZeroDivisionError is possible, despite a check seemingly intended to prevent it. The error's uncommonness lies in the fact that it occurs due to a condition not precisely covering all possible ways the division could fail, highlighting a potential pitfall of error handling in Python.
